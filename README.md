Terraform Provider TeamCity
==================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/leidruid/terraform-provider-teamcity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/leidruid/terraform-provider-teamcity)

Motivation:

[Building Builds: TeamCity Pipelines as Code using Terraform](https://leidruid.io/2018/11/building-builds---teamcity-pipelines-as-code-using-terraform/)

Installation
------------

## Binaries (Recommended)
The easiest way to install this provider is to use one of the binary distributions available as 
[Releases](https://github.com/leidruid/terraform-provider-teamcity/releases). 
It contains pre-compiled bundles for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Download and unpack the version for your OS/arch.  
In the example below, we use MacOS (darwin_amd64) and version `v0.5.1`:

```bash
VERSION=v0.5.1
wget https://github.com/leidruid/terraform-provider-teamcity/releases/download/$VERSION/terraform-provider-teamcity_darwin_amd64_$VERSION.zip
tar -xvf terraform-provider-teamcity_darwin_amd64_$VERSION.zip 
```

Then, copy the output file to your `~/.terraform.d/plugins` directory. 
For Windows, use the directory `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`

> **Note**: If you never installed any terraform providers before, you'll have to create that directory.

```bash
cp terraform-provider-teamcity_$VERSION ~/.terraform.d/plugins/
``` 

## Build from Source

### Requirements
-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x (advised 0.12+)
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.12 (to build the provider plugin)


Clone the repository to the directory of your choice, then from the root of repository, run the target below.
It is advisable to checkout a tag corresponding to a version first, instead of `master`.

If the [plugins directory](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-plugins) doesn't exist, you have to create it first.

```bash
$ VERSION=v0.5.1 make install
```
This will build a binary for your platform and place it on the . 

Using the provider
----------------------
To use it in your Terraform configurations after installing, declare a provider block:

```hcl-terraform
provider "teamcity" {
  address = "https://teamcity.yourserver.com:8112"
  username = "username"
  password = "password"
}
```

### Provider configuration via Environment Variables
All provider attributes above can be configured via environment variables. This is specially useful for credentials.

| Parameter | Environment Variable |
|-----------|----------------------|
| address   | TEAMCITY_ADDR        |
| username  | TEAMCITY_USER        |
| password  | TEAMCITY_PASS        |

> By using these variables, you may omit the attributes on the provider configuration, as they will be read from environment.

### Documentation

Documentation on available resources is under `website` directory in markdown format. 
If you would like to contribute to keep documentation error-free and up to date, please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.MD#).
This format is compatible with other providers on [Terraform Docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html).

Example Configurations
----------------------
You can find several sample configurations under `/examples`. As a best effort basis, the samples will be following 
the same terraform version as the provider is built against.  

There is a `.terraform-version` file that indicates the 
minimum terraform version to which the samples are compatible. Use of [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv) is recommended so you can run multiple
versions of terraform locally and switch based on the `.terraform-version` file.  

Please feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems, or contribute to new sample configurations.
